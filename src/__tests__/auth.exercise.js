// Testing Authentication API Routes

// 🐨 import the things you'll need
// 💰 here, I'll just give them to you. You're welcome
// import axios from 'axios'
// import {resetDb} from 'utils/db-utils'
// import * as generate from 'utils/generate'
// import {getData, handleRequestFailure} from 'utils/async'
// import startServer from '../start'

// 🐨 you'll need to start/stop the server using beforeAll and afterAll
// 💰 This might be helpful: server = await startServer({port: 8000})

// 🐨 beforeEach test in this file we want to reset the database

test('auth flow', async () => {
  // 🐨 get a username and password from generate.loginForm()
  //
  // register
  // 🐨 use axios.post to post the username and password to the registration endpoint
  // 💰 http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register
  //
  // 🐨 assert that the result you get back is correct
  // 💰 it'll have an id and a token that will be random every time.
  // You can either only check that `result.data.user.username` is correct, or
  // for a little extra credit 💯 you can try using `expect.any(String)`
  // (an asymmetric matcher) with toEqual.

  //
  // login
  // 🐨 use axios.post to post the username and password again, but to the login endpoint
  // 💰 http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login
  //
  // 🐨 assert that the result you get back is correct
  // 💰 tip: the data you get back is exactly the same as the data you get back
  // from the registration call, so this can be done really easily by comparing
  // the data of those results with toEqual
  //
  // authenticated request
  // 🐨 use axios.get(url, config) to GET the user's information
  // 💰 http://localhost:8000/api/auth/me
  // 💰 This request must be authenticated via the Authorization header which
  // you can add to the config object: {headers: {Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`}}
  // Remember that you have the token from the registration and login requests.
  //
  // 🐨 assert that the result you get back is correct
  // 💰 (again, this should be the same data you get back in the other requests,
  // so you can compare it with that).
